# Tag Counter

Simple counter for items split by ;

Created to count the number of tags added to tickets in the Helpdesk. Built in reporting didn't give this data. The program takes a list or CSV of words and counts each occurence.

Each word and the number of times it appears is output to a txt file.

The first CLI argument takes the source file and the second CLI argument is the output file name
